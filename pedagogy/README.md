#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Student will be able to index ring pattern | -Measuring the radius of the rings and find the ratio between them<br>-Compare the ratio of the rings with the ratio of the known crystal plane<br>-Identify the closely matching plane for corresponding ring<br> | From which type of material ring pattern is observed?<br><b>a.polycrystalline material</b><br>b.single crystal material
2.| Student will be able to index spot pattern | -Select the symmetry unit on the spot pattern<br>-Measure the length of the diffraction spots from the origin.<br>-Compare the ratio of the spots with the ratio of the known crystal plane<br>-Identify the closely matching plane for corresponding spots<br>-Find out the zone axis<br>  | From which type of material spot pattern is observed?<br>a.polycrystalline materials<br><b>b.single crystal material</b>

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will measure the distance of each ring. | Simulator enables to measure the distance of the ring from the origin  | To understand the indexing of the diffraction ring pattern.
2.| Student will measure the distance of selected diffraction pattern | Simulator enables to measure the distance between the selected spots  | To understand the indexing of the diffraction spot pattern
