1.Optimize the beam size in order to focus only on the region the diffraction pattern has to be obtained. Focus on a crystalline region.<br>
2.Obtain the diffraction pattern for a particular zone axis. The symmetry will pertain to the symmetry of real crystal.<br>
3.In order to obtain the 3-D symmetry information of the crystal, orient the crystal differently and obtain the diffraction pattern at other orientations as well.<br> 
4.Take the print-out of the diffraction pattern (or utilize any other software) and obtain the physical parameters from the image.<br>
5.Obtain the camera constant and from the (hkl) plane, and calculate the lattice parameter of the crystal.<br>
6.Index the diffraction patterns using the similarity of crystal systems
